# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles and general scripts I use.

There's an additional README in [bin/](bin/), since some of my scripts can be beneficial to others.

[config/](config/) mirrors the `~/.config` subdirectories I've invested time tweaking to my needs. Config files typically present in the home directory (i.e. `.bashrc`, `.vimrc`) are, likewise, at the root of this repository.
